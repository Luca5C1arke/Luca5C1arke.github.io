                <p class="text text--sml text--dark">As I’ve said my name is Jeff Zaninelli and I proudly own JZ Motors. You probably do not believe what I am claiming and offering here and maybe the conversation you’re having in your mind right now is “Oh! He’s just one of those ‘car salesmen’ who put up those promising lines to attract buyers. Blah blah blah… I’m sorry to tell you but I’ll say it straight up, that’s not true!!! In my life I have always believed that dreams are what distinguishes us from plants and animals and that no matter how difficult and how impossible those dreams may seem, it is in our innate essence to dream and make those dreams come true.</p>

                <p class="text text--sml text--dark">I know no matter how young or old you are; you have always wanted to own that “dream car”. You might think this dream car is difficult to have but really it is not! You can own the car of your dreams NOW! Fast and easy. Preloved cars? Used cars? Second-hand cars? Yes! What is in life aside from cars that isn’t one or all of those? Ahuh! Nada! Besides, it’s really impractical to buy a brand new car this month or year only to find out another new product will be released the following months or year! And worse still is the massive depreciation you cop when you buy a new vehicle. There is absolutely nothing wrong in buying used cars! In fact, it’s a win-win situation — you get the car of your dreams which is in good quality condition and in a cheaper price!</p>

                <h3 class="text__header text--lge text--dark">Our history</h3>
                <p class="text text--sml text--dark">Over the years I have developed an enormous following of very satisfied customers because of my ultimate goal: going an extra mile to look after my customers and this vision has paid off in the long run. A customer’s flat battery today may cost me a hundred dollars to fix but in 2 or 3 years when they want another vehicle they are loyal because they know they will get a fair deal and be looked after. In fact, I even have a local family that have purchased over 20 cars in the last 20 years and we have become good friends since. As a matter of fact they were present at my wedding and recently my wife and I went to their daughter’s wedding. But we’re not all work and no play here in JZ Motors, and as a way of giving back to the community we give sponsorships to local sporting clubs in the area. We sponsor the Ferntree Gully Footballers Cricket Club (for 14 years), Boronia Bowls club (for 18 years), 4 Reels Angling Club (for 5 years) and Scoresby Football Club (1 year).</p>
